## Website

- www.rescueme.life

## Creation Background

&emsp;&emsp;The journey of self redemption began with the AI dialogue website called "Rescue Me" created by my friend.
This name deeply touched my heart, it is a precious gift, not only bringing me wisdom, but also like a guiding light to
move forward. The profound meaning conveyed by this website has stimulated my desire for inner exploration and
self-improvement, becoming a refuge for my soul.

&emsp;&emsp;"RescueMe" literally translates as "self redemption". For me, it means finding my direction in the fog of
life, breaking free from constraints, and bravely facing inner challenges.

&emsp;&emsp;So, I hope to pass on this power, so that more people can also be encouraged to defeat their own "**HEART
DEMONS**".

## Development Status

- **Beta Stage**, the manuscript is currently being written and is tentatively scheduled for serialization.
